gpm (1.20.4-6.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Cleanup dependencies:
    - Remove dependency on obsolete package texi2html to fix lintian error.
    - While on it, remove unneeded dependency on texlive-base
    This is safe as it seems that gpm is not using texi2html and texlive-base,
    the generated Debian packages have identical documentation.
    This also has a nice side effect to reduce B-Ds a lot, and it looks like
    that this solves an dependency cycle.
  * Remove Pre-Depends on multiarch-support to fix lintian error.
  * Fixing lintian-warning h-clean-k-is-deprecated by using dh_prep instead.

  [ Peter Samuelson ]
  * Relabel "Twidddler" as "Handykey Twiddler" everywhere.
    For years I figured it was a cute marketing name.  Nope, just a typo.
  * gpm.config: if gpm.conf specifies at least 'type' and 'device', use it
    to preseed all fields; otherwise don't use it at all.  Previously we
    preseeded only non-empty values, which breaks if a gpm.conf value
    (such as repeat_type) is empty intentionally.  (Closes: #307638)
  * gpm.config: default to /dev/input/mice and no repeater, for 2.6 kernels.
    The repeater is pointless when you have the input layer.

  * Write a gpm.conf(5) manpage.  (Closes: #288606)
  * gpm.config: mark debconf questions as 'seen' if gpm.conf already
    exists.  (Closes: #289049)
  * debian/scripts/{lib,source.unpack}: tweak to make them work in the
    presence of .svn directories.  Obviously not for releases, but very
    useful for test builds.
  * debian/gpm.init: hack for kernel 2.6 asynchronous module loading.
    A hotplug script would be the right solution, but that's a major
    headache, not least because we can't rely on hotplug being functional.
    (Closes: #298197)
  * debian/rules: add a 'checkpo' target. Thanks Alexis Sukrieh.
  * debian/gpm.config, debian/gpm.templates: remove the "remember the
    restart setting?" question.  I honestly don't know what we were
    thinking.  "Of course remember the setting, otherwise I can run
    dpkg-reconfigure on it!"  (See #289165 - but this doesn't close it.)

  * Fix init script bug which has been present since hamm:
    the append= in gpm.conf uses a quoted string of args which themselves
    might be quoted and need to be unquoted.  "eval" does this.  The
    practical effect is that systems installed from hamm or slink will no
    longer consider " to be a word character.  It was never intended to be

  * gpm.prerm: rewrite stop_gpm() to fix 3 bugs and improve readability:
    - space after \ line continuation char
    - 'gpm -x' should be 'gpm -k'
    - return success, not failure, if the daemon wasn't running
    (Closes: #266937)
  * gpm.postinst: only set up /dev/mouse if it doesn't already exist.
    It should not ever be needed anyway, and breaks the occasional
    config.  Also teach it about repeat_type=none and multi-level
    device names like /dev/input/mice.  (Closes: #266983)
  * gpm.init: minor UI issues:
    - print newlines after errors on start / stop targets
    - if stop failed on restart, do not bother to 'sleep 3'
    - propagate start failure on restart
  * gpm.templates: Reword gpm/restart so as not to imply that the user
    *is* necessarily in X.  We actually do not know this at the time.

gpm (1.12-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed spurious liblow.c.orig which was bloating the diff.gz.

    on URLs easier.

    alterations to the info file and man page.

    since the problems reported in #7343 don't happen to
    everyone [#10929].
